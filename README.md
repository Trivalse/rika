This is a collection of modules and libraries that can be used to create your own A.I. assistant! The basic modules are coherently packaged together and are usually wrapped for modularity, while the main.cpp file provides examples of use and act as a general template. A Code::Blocks project file is also provided with all modules already added.

Want to try it out? Download release version 1.0 [here](https://github.com/Trivalse/rika/releases) and start from the first [blog](https://rikatherobot.tumblr.com/) post; it'll enable you to interact with your A.I. assistance using speech and dialogue responses.
